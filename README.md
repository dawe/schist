# SCHIST
An interface for Nested Stochastic Block Model for single cell analysis. The idea behind `schist` is to create a `scanpy`-compatible interface to `graph-tool` methods.

## Installation
As `schist` is available from conda-forge, installation is just easy as

```
conda install -c conda-forge schist
```

This will install `graph-tool-base` package as dependency, which does not include complete graphical capabilities. If you need access to the full `graph-tool` infrastracture, install it with

```
conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool
```

If you want to install `schist` from source, clone this repository and install in the usual way

```
git clone https://github.com/dawe/schist.git
cd schist
pip install .
```

## How to use
Once `schist` has been installed, it can be used out of the box on `scanpy` objects:

```python
import schist as scs

scs.inference.nested_model(adata)
```

Once the MCMC has converged, the `adata.obs` object will contain additional columns for multiple levels, named `nsbm_level_0`, `nsbm_level_1`, `nsbm_level_2` and so on (by default up to `nsbm_level_10`). 
Complete documentation can be found at [this page](https://schist.readthedocs.io)

## Name
`schist` is a [type of rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schist). Previous name for this project was `scNSBM`, which was hard to pronounce and caused typos when writing (`scnbsm` or `scbsnm` and so onâ€¦). We looked for a name which should have "single cell" in it (sc), something about the stochastic model (st) and something about the hierarchy (hi). That's were `schist` comes from.
