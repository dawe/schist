Analysis of spatially resolved multimodal data
==============================================

Here we put all together, showcasing an advanced usage of models provided by `schist`. We use the data of a mouse embryo profiled with DBiT-seq by RNA and ATAC on the same slice.
The tutorial is divided in three pages, one for ATAC, one for RNA and one putting everything in a single place. Due to space constrains we do not upload raw data here, we will show the results after read alignment.
