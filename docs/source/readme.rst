SCHIST
======
.. highlight:: python

An interface for Nested Stochastic Block Model for single cell analysis. The idea behind ``schist`` is to create a `scanpy`-compatible interface to ``graph-tool`` methods.

Installation
------------

As ``schist`` is available from conda-forge, installation is just easy as
::

    conda install -c conda-forge schist


This will install ``graph-tool-base`` package as dependency, which does not include complete graphical capabilities. If you need access to the full ``graph-tool`` infrastracture, install it with::


    conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool


If you want to install ``schist`` from source, clone this repository and install in the usual way

::

    git clone https://github.com/dawe/schist.git
    cd schist
    pip install .


How to use
----------

Once ``schist`` has been installed, it can be used out of the box on ``scanpy`` objects::

    import schist as scs
    scs.inference.nested_model(adata)


Once the MCMC has converged, the ``adata.obs`` object will contain additional columns for multiple levels, named ``nsbm_level_0``, ``nsbm_level_1``, ``nsbm_level_2`` and so on.

Name
----

``schist`` is a `type of rock <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schist>`_. Previous name for this project was ``scNSBM``, which was hard to pronounce and caused typos when writing (``scnbsm`` or ``scbsnm`` and so onâ€¦). We looked for a name which should have "single cell" in it (sc), something about the stochastic model (st) and something about the hierarchy (hi). That's were ``schist`` comes from.
