Status
######

- Version 0.7.2 It is now possible to run leiden clustering, but this is performed many times (default 100), a consensus is calculated as well as marginals for cluster assignments.
- Version 0.7.0 Some changes in the way nested model is calculated. Also, advanced functions have been eliminated, one should use `graph_tool` for that
- Version 0.6.0 PlantedModel fully supported. Also, some changes in the data structure (affinities in obsm)
- Version 0.5.2 Fast model for NSBM (and PP).
- Version 0.5.0 Introduces Planted Partition model
- Version 0.4.2 Introduces functions to calculate cluster consistency.
- Version 0.4.0 Some bugfixes and name change to `schist`
- Version 0.3.1 It is possible to resume operatons on a previously modeled state (i.e. you can do two step analysis)
- Version 0.3.0 Major changes in the way MCMC is performed. SBM is also available.
- Version 0.2.5 extends `scanpy.tools.draw_graph` layouts to the ones available in `graph-tool` library
- Version 0.2 The code for the interface is mature. It is also possible to read/write objects
- Version 0.1 implements a working interface to `graph-tool` library for `scanpy`

How to use
##########

Once `schist` has been installed, it can be used out of the box on `scanpy` objects:

::

	import schist

	schist.inference.nested_model(adata)


Once the MCMC has converged, the `adata.obs` object will contain additional columns for multiple levels, named `nsbm_level_1`, `nsbm_level_2` and so on (by default up to `nsbm_level_10`).

Installation
############

The key component (`graph-tool`) is not available through pip and requires extra compilation by the user, refer to its installation page `<https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/-/wikis/installation-instructions>`_. Note, however, that a conda package is available from conda-forge, that means you may install it (and `schist` dependencies) just issuing

::

	conda create -n schist -c conda-forge -c bioconda numpy scipy anndata pandas 'graph-tool>=2.37' scanpy	
	conda activate schist


After that, `schist` can be installed from source:

::

	git clone https://github.com/dawe/schist.git
	cd schist
	pip install .

Saving objects
**************

`schist` allows to return the `NestedBlockState` or `PPBlockState` object in `adata.uns['nsbm']['state']` slot. Unfortunately, this object cannot be dumped into `.h5ad` files by the `sc.write()` function. If you returned the state, e.g. for debugging, you should pop it out from your dataset before writing:

::

	state = adata.uns['nsbm'].pop('state')
	adata.write('myfile.h5ad')

	## save the state separately
	import pickle
	with open('state.pkl', 'wb') as pkl_state:
    		pickle.dump(state, pkl_state, 2)

Since version 0.2 it is possible to save `AnnData` objects like above simply issuing

::

	schist.io.write(adata, prefix='myfile')

This will create two files: `myfile.h5ad`, containing the actual `AnnData`, and 
`myfile.pkl` containing the pickled state. With the same logic, assuming the two files
are in the same place, issuing

::

	adata = schist.io.read('myfile')

will read the `.h5ad` and the `.pkl` files and create the proper `AnnData` object
